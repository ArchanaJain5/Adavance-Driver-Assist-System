# Adavance-Driver-Assist-System
This project is on building Advanced Driver Assist System which could warn the driver when he/she feels drowsy using Opencv Python and other computer vision techniques

In this model the system gets the constant input from the camera. The video captured is divided into frames and further processing is done by the system. The images obtained are converted into an grayscale image and region of interest is found. The system is divided into two parts: detection of head movement and yawn detection.

B.	ALGORITHM FOR HEAD MOVEMENT - headmovement.txt
